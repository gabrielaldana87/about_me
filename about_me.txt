Hi! My name is Gabriel.\r\n\r\nI'm a full-stack web developer. I'm knowledgeable in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, node.js, git, SQL and VBA.\r\n\r\nI have experience in the health informatics field, having worked in data reporting and analysis. I have a background in database administration. Prior to my involvement in web development languages and frameworks, I was well-versed in advanced Microsoft Excel
and SQL. My work in database management has exposed me to the visual representation of data and providing an intuitive and
informative user experience.\r\n\r\nMy exposure to computer languages has now allowed me an additional platform to showcase data in an intuitive and exciting way.
